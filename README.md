# CS490-Capstone
Capstone Project - 2015 Spring

I will be posting deadlines in this github. Any configs that are created will be uploaded here and such. We shouldn't have to need any storage space other than small documents so this should work fine.

When using github, please make sure any changes you give a comment on it. So I can keep track of who changed or added what for anything :)
